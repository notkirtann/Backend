# ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. It allows developers to interact with a database using the programming language's native objects, rather than writing raw SQL queries.

#### Example of popular ORM Libraries:
- **Prisma**: A next-generation ORM that consists of a query engine, a type-safe database client, and a migration system. Designed to work with TypeScript and JavaScript. 
- **Drizzle ORM**: A lightweight and type-safe ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript, designed to work with SQL databases.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Hibernate**: A Java-based ORM that provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database.
- **Sequelize**: A promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- **TypeORM**: An ORM that can run in Node.js, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript.

## TypeScript Installation Guide
`npm init -y`

`npm i -D typescript`

`npx tsc --init`

This command creates a `tsconfig.json` file in your project directory, which you can customize to configure the TypeScript compiler options according to your project's needs.

In TS config file you can set:
- "target": Specifies the ECMAScript target version (e.g., "ES5", "ES6", "ESNext").
- "module": Defines the module system to use (e.g., "commonjs", "es6").
- "strict": Enables all strict type-checking options.
- "outDir": Specifies the output directory for compiled JavaScript files.


As you know i have recently completed 3 months of my internship here, i have completed all the task i have received in timely manner and have gotten  good feedback . Moving forward if possible now i would like to pursue full job here, I like the work culture here (etc). If 6 months in to my employment you don't like my work you can release me immediately. It would also  be good for my career to get atleast 6 months of experience here.

If the manager says, "But I told you we need 4 years of experience," you should respond with:

"I understand, but for the next 6 months, I can handle the workload of a full-time junior developer at a much better value for the company. It allows me to grow and ensures the team has a dedicated resource to hit our immediate goals."
